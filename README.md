# Heart-Attack-Predictor

In this project, I leveraged Python to conduct an in-depth analysis of a heart attack dataset, aiming to uncover pivotal factors associated with heart attacks. One of the standout findings from this analysis is that smokers are significantly more susceptible to heart attacks, with a striking 89.5% higher likelihood compared to non-smokers. Furthermore, the presence of Diabetes emerged as a substantial risk factor for heart attacks. Additionally, my investigation underscored the correlation between age and heart attack incidence, demonstrating a progressively heightened risk with advancing age. This project not only honed my Python proficiency but also sharpened my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets, showcasing my analytical prowess and commitment to impactful data-driven decision-making.
